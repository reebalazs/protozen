Enlightened protobuf communication support from Javascript front-ends to Erlang or Golang servers

This project is not doing anything useful at the moment.

It can be used as a template for a setup that contains a toolchain for the development of JavaScript
web front-ends, that use protocol buffers as communication with an Erlang or Golang server.

In the future, it will be further developed to improve protobuf communication with built in pubsub and
data streaming.

I am not supporting this code right now, which means that errors will not be fixed for now.
